  Hi, thank you for stopping by my website
  </p>
  <p>
    I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Vietnam National University in 2021, where I ranked in the top 1% of my cohort.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. <a href="https://jianqing-liu.github.io/index.html target="_blank"">Jianqing Liu</a>. 
    My research focuses on quantum sensing, quantum networking, and the design of quantum algorithms for combinatorial problems. Along the way, I have received the Outstanding PhD Student Award and student travel grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF).
