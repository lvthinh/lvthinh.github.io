  Bosonic quantum computation harnesses the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators, offering scalable architectures with inherent error correction advantages over qubit-based systems. Despite their potential, bosonic modes encounter significant challenges from prevalent noise sources, particularly photon loss and dephasing, which degrade quantum coherence. Among bosonic error-correcting codes, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code stands out for its ability to correct small phase-space displacements, enabling applications in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. While ideal GKP states require infinite squeezing and are unphysical, the finite squeezing approximate GKP states have been experimentally realized, though their performance depends critically on the squeezing level and measurement strategies. This work addresses a central challenge: how to optimize the squeezing parameter of approximate GKP states and the local oscillator (LO) phase in homodyne detection to maximize precision in estimating bosonic loss-dephasing channel parameters. To address this question, we introduce an adaptive optimization framework guided by classical Fisher information (CFI) and quantum Fisher information (QFI). Numerical simulations demonstrate that this adaptive protocol consistently converges to optimal parameter configurations, determining optimized squeezing levels and LO phases. By offering a practical approach to high-precision quantum channel parameter estimation, this framework has broad implications, from quantum metrology to enabling robust quantum communication systems.
