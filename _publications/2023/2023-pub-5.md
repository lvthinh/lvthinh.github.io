  Quantum annealing (QA) is a promising optimization technique used to find global optimal solution of a combinatorial optimization problem by leveraging quantum fluctuations. In QA, the problem being solved is mapped onto the quantum processing unit (QPU) composed of qubits through a procedure called minor-embedding. The qubits are connected by a network of couplers, which determine the strength of the interactions between the qubits. The strength of the couplers that connect qubits within a chain is often referred to as the chain strength. The appropriate balance of chain strength is equally imperative in enabling the qubits to interact with one another in a way that is strong enough to obtain the optimal solution, but not excessively strong so as not to bias the original problem terms. To this end, we address the problem of identifying the optimal chain strength through the utilization of Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) quantum simulation algorithm. The results indicate that our judicious choice of chain strength parameter facilitates enhancements in quantum annealer performance and solution quality, thereby paving the way for QA to compete with, or potentially outperform, classical optimization algorithms.
