  The quantum internet is on the cusp of a revolution. While it shares the same purpose as the classical internet --- connecting devices and transmitting information, the underlying principle of quantum physics makes the quantum internet a disruptive technology that will enable services unmatched by the classical internet. The quantum internet design has moved beyond theory. The past decade has seen a surge of efforts among researchers worldwide in building quantum network testbeds, a crucial stepping stone toward the quantum internet. In this review paper, we will summarize recent progress on quantum network testbeds, highlighting their major demonstrations and achievements. This progress report is the first of its kind in the literature, offering a holistic view of past regional efforts and prompting the community to assess our current position. Moreover, this paper will discuss open challenges and envision a collaborative pathway forward for the development of the quantum internet.
