#   The Selective Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a reasonably common variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This variation factors in the resource limitation of the salesman against his objective of maximizing the rewards collected at each city he arrives, which is especially useful in such fields as logistic optimization. STSP has been proven to be an NP-Hard problem and many research proposing classical heuristic solutions has been published over the years. In this paper, we examine Quantum Annealing (QA), an optimization procedure grounded on the principle of adiabatic quantum computation, in solving STSP. In particular, we propose the reformulation of the combinatorial problem STSP into the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, a model that can be embedded into the quantum annealer. We execute experiments with our presented formulation on the D-Wave quantum hardware and retrieve optimal solutions for a small number of instances.
